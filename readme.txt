In this project, I will look at 3000 tweets per day that have the following cryptocurrency names: 
keywords = ['Dogecoin','Bitcoin','Ethereum','Tether', 'XRP'] 

I will drop Retweets and consider the number of likes per tweet as well as other variables.  

I was also able to set a scheduled pull from the twitter API with the below link.

The reason on why I scheduled and set a number of tweets per pull is due to the limit twitter gives their non-premium API users.
